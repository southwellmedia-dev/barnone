Firehouse flooring done right! Bar None Coatings delivered a full topcoat transformation across four bays at the Elmo Fire Department, followed by bold red safety striping to finish the job strong.

Within 72 hours, these lanes were ready for full-duty use, rain or shine, day or night. Built tough for the heroes who serve our community.
